Hi, I am Rajat Kateja! I am a software engineer by profession. But I don't stop at just software. I like to engineer my entire life. Part of life engineering is on being able to do the things I enjoy. Learning computer science and writing are two such things.

When I tried to share these interests of mine with the sculpture at my local library, he wasn't too responsive. So I put together this blog. Maybe you will find it more interesting?

You can find me at linkedin, twitter, or good old email.
